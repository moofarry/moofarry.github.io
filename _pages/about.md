<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a MS student of computer science in Universidad Santiago de Cali(USC) and right now i am working on a research project on speaker recognition. 
Previously, I obtained a BEng degree as Electronic Engineering with emphasis in Signal Processing from the USC. 

My undergraduate degree project was entitled "computer system for the diagnosis Parkinsonâ€™s disease detection using modulation components in speech signals" and this work consisted in the development of a pattern recognition system capable of detecting if a person has the pathology, thus giving a great support to the specialists in this area.
